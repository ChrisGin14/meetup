# Security testing related questions: (Answered by Jumo representative and security Guru) 
- ## In regards to NFC not requiring a password: "What is your opinion on the security?" (Winning question for the evening)
  It is really nice and convenient. There is more accountability with NFC than there is with cash. There is a limit to how much can be used for it. So there is minimal liability for the user.  
  (What is NFC: Near-field communication (NFC) is a set of communication protocols that enable two electronic devices, one of which is usually a portable device such as a smartphone, to establish communication by bringing them within 4 cm (1.6 in) of each other.

- ## (Context: Related to password security) What repercussions are there besides reputational?  
  It seems as if companies in South Africa dealing with password needs or generated password needs don’t really have any?
  In the South Africa context, South Africans are used to crime without consequences. So South African banks are more geared for preventions rather than there being consequences. 
  Instead of trying to find security holes you rather look at ways to catch people? The preferred way is to know what exactly happened (once you have been hacked for example, before trying to sue the person and hold them responsible it is important to first know exactly what went wrong first) We tend to rather focus on what’s happening before it escalates into something really bad.
  Many companies have there sites hacked and hackers inject adverts, the impact of this is very minimal. However, if they had changed all the user’s usernames and password to internet banking, that would have more impact. 

- ## Are there ever any hair raising moments where you needed to yank out cables?
  A senior executive at a company complained about a message that he closed that caused him to loose connectivity. It wasn’t actually a serious issue in the end, but it could have been.
