## "Security Testing from an attacker's perspective!" 
### Craig Swan

Sure, youâ€™re no professional Pen Tester but what are the easy things you can do (and should be doing!) to protect your software against attackers?
The illustrious security expert, Craig Swan, took us through how to ethically hack into a machine over a wifi network using social engineering, SQL injection and other nifty techniques. 

Craig also demonstrated what a web development team can do to make their work secure before the professional pen testers even get involved. 

As the talk progressed, attendees competed against each other to hack the presenters laptop over the local wifi network!
