# Video Game Development Testing

### Background
We've teamed up with [Make Games South Africa](http://makegamessa.com/discussion/4871/cape-town-testing-meetups-get-your-game-tested-by-software-testers) to bring video game testing to the Cape Town Testing meetups!

 * **What's in it for the game companies?** Free testing and feedback from professional software developers.

 * **What's in it for Cape Town Testing?** Having new games at our meetups is quite simply pretty damn cool and fun!

Make Games SA meets on the last Wednesday of every month. Follow their [blog](http://makegamessa.com/) or on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MakeGamesSouthAfrica/) to get the latest news regarding their community.

### Pilot

[Clockwork Acorn](http://clockworkacorn.com/), Clockwork Acorn is an interactive software development studio based in Cape Town, is piloting this potentially great symbiotic relationship between our two communities and will be hosting a table at our Q2 meetup. 

#### Jetstream
Clockwork Acorn's new game is called [Jetstream](http://jetstreamgame.com/). It's described as "an elegant puzzle game where you soar amongst the clouds. Play through dozens of sculpted levels as you travel around the globe" and will be launched around August 2017.
