# Video Game Development Testing

### Background
We've teamed up with [Make Games South Africa](http://makegamessa.com/discussion/4871/cape-town-testing-meetups-get-your-game-tested-by-software-testers) to bring video game testing to the Cape Town Testing meetups!

**What's in it for the game companies?** Free testing and feedback from professional software developers.

**What's in it for us?** Having new games at our meetups is simply pretty damn cool and fun!

Make Games SA meets on the last Wednesday of every month. Follow their [blog](http://makegamessa.com/) or on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MakeGamesSouthAfrica/) to get the latest news regarding their community.
