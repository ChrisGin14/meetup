# The Dice Game

## Overview

In this game, players compete individually against the Gamemaster.

At each round, players try to guess the silent and consistent rule the gamemaster has set.

## Equipment

As many dice as available (of as many different colours, sizes, shapes, etc as possible - the more variety the collection of dice has, the better.

**Gameplay:** 

This game progresses in levels (level 1 – easiest, level 2 – more difficult, etc.).

Each level is represented as a secret rule the Gamemaster has, that players must try work out.

During each level a collection of dice is thrown repeatedly.

After each roll, each player has a chance to guess the rule that the gamemaster has in his head by saying the number that is produced by applying the gamemaster's secret rule to the dice throw results. 

Once each player has made an attempt at the number, the gamemaster applies his secret formula to the dice and gives the answers to all of the players.

The goal for each level is to reliably predict the number that the Game master will say.

The round continues until all the players have either figured out the gamemasters pattern/formula/secret rule...or have given up! 

Note: Players are _never_ to be told the rule but other players (it is not unheard of forplayers neverto  find out the strange rule a friend once set when playing The Dice Game.)

## Examples of level secret rules
* Level 0: Simply count the number of odd dice.
* Level 1: Only count a certain colour of dice, regardless of dots or number, etc.
* Level x: _…Your imagination is the limit!*_
*Making up rules: Think about every possible dimension of a dice throw to formulate new rules:
  * Where each dice lands? (e.g. rule: Only count dice that land on x)
  *	What is visible to you, as gamemaster (e.g. rule: How many single dots can I see?)
  *	Colour of dice, colour of ink/engraving (e.g. rule: count up the number of vowels in the colour of the dice)
  *	Shape of ink/engraving (e.g. rule: Count the outside dots only if there’s a dot in the middle)
  *	What other rules can you think of?

## Outcomes
A great resourdce for an experience and outcomes of The Dice Game [here](http://www.bettertesting.co.uk/content/?p=438).

Rather than simply getting the correct answer, the exploratory testing process is more important. 
The Dice Game gives valuable practice in forming a hypothesis and validating or refuting the hypothesis though testing.

**Skills:** Pattern recognition, creativity, create and refuting hypotheses through the scientific process.
