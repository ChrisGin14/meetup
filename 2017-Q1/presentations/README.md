# 2017-Q1 Presentations

## "Measurement and trust" 
### Irfaan Imamdin

As people who test things, we believe that the more deeply we understand our tools, technologies and purpose of what we do, the better the insights we have into how well our things work.

This lightning talk will  try and challenge what insight really is, and what the differences between understanding people and things are.

**Summary notes taken live at the meetup:** Validating the basis for our understanding, related to simple, everyday concepts makes us realise that our understanding and insights are based on assumptions that we accept to be true. Holding these assumptions true within the framework of a solution may not always produce a 100% empirically correct solution, but there is a balance that must be struck between the precision of the solution versus achieving the underlying motivations for the solution. 

## "Testing stacked" 
### Shakes Ramphal
This will be the first in a series of many testing stack chats presented by different companies over the course of coming Cape Town Testing meetups.

Shakes will breaking down one Allan Gray team’s approach on building quality software, fast. 

The short presentation will touch on the strategy to empower testers with ability to throw out buzz words like React, Nightwatch, JavaScript… with confidence, as well as make a decent cuppa mocha or chai.

**Summary notes taken live at the meetup:** An optimal testing environment is a balancing act between robustness and flexibility. Allan Gray's testing stack was reviewed in terms of its microservice architecture and the tools used to maintain this architectural model. The  testing framework is therefore aligned to Allan Gray's web stack context.   

## "Keep Critical: The Impact of Coding on the Testing Mindset" 
### Rob Herbst
The increasing pace of software development is forcing companies to embrace automated testing. What used to be the job of humans is becoming the job of computers. More and more the people doing the testing are being expected to write automated test suites. 

This talk will look at potential consequences of combining testing and coding into one role and how one might provide optimal value when testing software.

**Summary notes taken live at the meetup:** A testing mindset is not limited to the tester role. Developers, analysts and testers alike should realise that they have a vested interest in building quality solutions. The "make it" or "break it" mindset is a valuable mindset to interrogate the quality of an application, and the separation of duty between development and testing roles is important to prevent an imbalance towards either mindset. Business context and user motivation is a core tenet of any good testing mindset, and should be complemented (not replaced) by a proficiency for programming knowledge.

Allan Gray's microservice architecture was then examined in terms of the test suites which cover web products and web applications, and the pyramid testing approach utilised to best optimise the quality of the solution.
