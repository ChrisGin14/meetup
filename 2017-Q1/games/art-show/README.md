# Art show

## Overview

Teams compete against each other in this game. 
Should be 2/3+ players per team


## Equipment

A deck of cards per team.

## Instructions to players
The game master is an "art buyer" applying a rule to the cards shown by the teams.

**Background:** The game master likes to buy fine "Art"; the teamâ€™s goal is to figure out what kind of art I like to buy.

**Gameplay:** At the teams own pace, teams do an "art showing" of, usually, 1 to 5 art pieces (cards) at a time. 

The game master will select **and take away** the art pieces he/she likes (applying a consistent and silent selection rule to the cards).

Teams may take as many rounds as you like, and show as many cards asthey like per round.

How teams can  win: When a team is ready, a team must do their "final showing" - this  team will show me 5 pieces of art, if the game master likes every single piece of art shown, that team wins the game. 

How teams can lose: 
* If at your teams "final showing" the game master doesn not like and take all 5 art peices, the team loses.
* If a team runs out of cards, that team loses.
* If the any other teams wins before a given team, that team loses.

## Outcomes
Rather than simply getting the correct answer, the exploratory testing process is what becomes important in "Art Show". 

What's special about Art Show (as opposed to, say, the dice game) is that it introduces an element of finite resources.

In short, Art Show helps players practice their skills in forming a hypothesis and validating or refuting this hypothesis though testing while optimizing for speed, coverage and cost (because you may lose cards each time you run a test, or rather, do an "Art show").

Skills: Pattern recognition, Risk appreciation (limited time, and resources)
