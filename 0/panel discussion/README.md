#Panel discussion

## Topic: "Does a good tester have to be able to read/ write code or automate?" 

### Background
We know that developers love writing code and that testers love testing code – but try and find a developer that wants to test or a tester that can write code – and you’re left looking for silver bullets and needles in haystacks...or that’s how it can feel. 

Over the past year, we’ve been looking for good testers who can (and want to) write good code – we interviewed many and…well let’s just say - we’re still looking. 
So the question came up *_"Does a good tester have to be able to read / write code or automate?"_* 
Unlike the speakers / presenters before – the panel members doesn’t claim to have the answer – but each of them has an opinion and so, hopefully you do too. 

###Panel members

* Louise Perold (Let's Test SA Conf, House of Test)
* Cassandra Munro (Global Kinetic)

### Summary of points discussed
"Reading and writing code improves my skills as a tester - I lose something when (a unit of functionality) is too technical"
	- "Different strokes for different folks".

No - reading and writing code will not MAKE you a good tester. 
	- A "good" tester doesn't need to write code.
	- "We want to know we are doing the right thing, before knowing that we are doing it the right way"

No - need strategies to compensate if testers can't write code
- don't be scared
- pairing with developers is okay
- keep a critical mindset
- benefit = problem focus

Testers should be able to read and understand coding logic
Shouldn't be a coder/dev and a tester
- don't build the feature
- don't test your own work

Is being a good tester not good enough any more?
- Manual testers: value increases slowly over time
- Automated testers: value is higher from the outset and normalizes over a longer period

Testing is what we do - performant
Manual/Automated: tools help make testers better at their jobs

* Industry Trend - to have skills or knowledge?
- moving away from passion/thinking
Skills in tools? or ability to automate?

Need to know how to use tools, which may be a technical challenge
- however, one should improve all aspects of skill sets
- Tools do not make a good tester

Does tester need to be able to read/write/understand code?
- depends on the role that the tester is in
- depends on the project

BUT WHAT IS A GOOD TESTER?
- Need to help the team to succeed
- Depends on the role and context of the tester
- Good testers identify risks as soon as possible and communicate them
    - Not just reporting an error, but diagnose errors and help to prevent them
 
Does technology make you better at diagnostics?
	- Testing is not a single skill set; testers are jacks of all trades
	- ±50% write code and ±50% test

While tech skills might improve efficiency, critical thinking is imperative in order to be effective

Good testers break things and break them often

Technical skills and understanding code help find causes of errors quicker

Focus is on high quality product, and technical skills help me to be more efficient
	- Business context influences skills

"The best bug report is a pull request which includes a fix"

Skills of testers change depending on the stage of the SDLC
	- Pairing with devs vs. end-to-end of product
	- Automation tester needs a test analyst
  - Work in pairs
