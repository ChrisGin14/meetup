#Panel discussion

## Topic: "Does a good tester have to be able to read/ write code or automate?" 

### Background
We know that developers love writing code and that testers love testing code – but try and find a developer that wants to test or a tester that can write code – and you’re left looking for silver bullets and needles in haystacks...or that’s how it can feel. 

Over the past year, we’ve been looking for good testers who can (and want to) write good code – we interviewed many and…well let’s just say - we’re still looking. 
So the question came up *_"Does a good tester have to be able to read / write code or automate?"_* 
Unlike the speakers / presenters before – the panel members doesn’t claim to have the answer – but each of them has an opinion and so, hopefully you do too. 

###Panel members
