# Testing Taboo!

## Overview

Teams compete against each other in this game. 
Should be 2/3+ players per team


## Equipment

Taboo Cards (some populated with words, some can be blank), sand timers, “buzzers” (something that alerts that a taboo word has been used)
Example cards can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3E1sKJ8quaCbE1LdjYwaVlYWU0)

## Instructions to players

**Gameplay:** At the teams own pace, teams do an "art showing" of, usually, 1 to 5 art pieces (cards) at a time. The game master will select **and take away**The rules of the game “Taboo” are: 
* You have two teams (A and B). Players from each team must sit alternating (ABABABA…) in a circle.
* A player from team B starts a timer.
* A player of Team A starts: The player draws a card from the pile. 
  *  Each card has a term at the top of the card which the player must get his/her teammates to say. The player must achieve this without using any of the 5 taboo words, which are listed on the card below the main word. 
  * If teammates guess the right word, the team earns 1 point, and the player draws the next card, and continues. 
  * If Player A uses a forbidden word, the card is discarded. 
  * At any time, players may choose to discard any card and draw a new one. 
* One Player of Team B (neighbor of A) is watching Player A and triggers the buzzer if a forbidden/taboo word is used (aka The Buzzmaster)
* Another Player of Team B is watching the sand time (aka The Timemaster)
* After the round is finished, the next player (from the next team) in the circle goes (in this example, Team B is guessing, Team A is watching).

## Outcomes
Software Development is primarily about collaboration and communication within teams and with external stakeholders. 
Communication with stakeholders can be a delicate activity, with team members sometimes having to avoid terms that may be controversial to stakeholders (in German these are known as: “Reizwort”). A teter friend of mine once had the situation where, although he was part of a self-organized team, but use of any Scrum terms was problematic for management. So we had to work with synonyms (i.e. iteration instead of sprint). So this workshop is a practical and gamified exercise for getting better at describing things without naming them.
