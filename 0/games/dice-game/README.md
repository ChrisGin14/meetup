# The Dice Game

## Overview

In this game, players compete individually against the Gamemaster.
At each round, players try to guess the silent and consistent rule the gamemaster has set.

## Equipment

As many dice as available (of as many different colours, sizes, shapes, etc as possible - the more variety the collection of dice has, the better.

## Instructions to players
This game progresses in levels (level 1 – easiest, level 2 – more difficult, etc.).

**Gameplay:** 
Each level is represented as a secret rule the Gamemaster has, that players must try work out.
During a level a collection of dice is thrown repeatedly.
After each roll, each player has a chance to guess the rule that the gamemaster has in his head by saying the number that is produced by applying the gamemaster's secret rule to the dice throw results. 
Once each player has made an attempt at the number, the gamemaster applies his secret formula to the dice and gives the answers to all of the players.
The round continues until all the players have either figured out the gamemasters pattern/formula/secret rule...or have given up! 
Note: Players are _never_ to be told the rule but other players (it is not unheard of forplayers neverto  find out the strange rule a friend once set when playing The Dice Game.)
## Outcomes
WIP ~~Rather than simply getting the correct answer, the exploratory testing process is what becomes important in "Art Show".
What's special about Art Show (as opposed to, say, the dice game) is that it introduces an element of finite resources to
In short, Art Show helps players practice their skills in forming a hypothesis and validating or refuting this hypothesis though testing while optimizing for speed, coverage and cost (because you may lose cards each time you run a test, or rather, do an "Art show").
Skills: Pattern recognition, Risk appreciation (limited time, and resources)~~
