### Review:

On Saturday, 1 April 2017 Cape Town Testing hosted the Cape Town leg of CS50x Puzzle Day 2017 (virtually hosted by Harvard and Facebook). The CS50x Puzzle Day perfectly aligned with Cape Town Testing’s aim of improving critical thinking and challenging the status quo. Puzzle Day was a fun-filled event that we thoroughly enjoyed sharing with our critical thinking community, and we look forward to many more hype events such as this one!

We ultimately hosted 3 teams of the world-wide total of 297 teams comprising of 750 participants - thank you to all the teams that came by to solve puzzles, develop their critical thinking, eat free pizza and contribute to our community.

In the follow-up world-wide survey of the event, the majority of teams (60.9%) felt that the puzzles were too hard, indicative of the number of puzzles solved globally - 62% of teams managed to solve only 2 puzzles or less, with the average number of puzzles solved being 2.5 puzzles per team!

Of the teams who participated, an honourable mention goes to the following Cape Town Testing teams who submitted their solutions online:

Fire Breathing Rubber Dukkies
RICK
Surprise4

And an extra special mention goes out to Cape Town Testing’s Team RICK, who submitted 4/8 correct solutions, placing them in the top 20% globally! Well done to: Robert Herbst, Irfaan Imamdin, Clarissa Johnston and Karin Herbst!

Solutions to all of the puzzles can be found here.


Cape Town Testing: Q2 Meetup Reminder! 

Don't forget to RSVP to our Cape Town Testing Quarter 2 meetup, which will be hosted by JUMO on Tuesday 6 June 2017. We decided to reschedule the original meetup date due to the refurbishing of the shiny new “JUMO Tap" venue, which we know you'll love.

This is definitely one not to miss, folks!

A little teaser: The illustrious security expert, Craig Swan, will be taking us through how to ethically hack into a machine over a wifi network using social engineering and other nifty techniques (so bring your laptops!), he’ll also be demonstrating what a web development team can do to make their work secure before the professional pen testers even get involved.

Lastly, don't forget to connect with us on Meetup­, Twitter­ and Facebook­ to get to-the-minute updates.

Have a great week back at work!
