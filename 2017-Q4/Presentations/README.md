# 2017-Q4 Presentations

## "Testing Trends: DevOps" 
### Gatu Vasani, CA Technologies 

The talk will be around articulating some of the constraints that the software quality assurance (SQA) practices work under today and more importantly, how the negative impact of these can be minimised. Gatu will contextualise it via a brief discussion/presentation around DevOps and the role of the SQA practise in delivering on the promise of DevOps. Gatu will also discuss the nature of the technological as well as organisational constraints and obstructions which almost always lead to quality-compromised apps that are released for consumption by customers.

## “0 to Seleniero in 15 minutes!”
### Shekhar Ramphal

Everyone can automate! Shakes will get you setup and starting to write your own automated front-end tests in just 15 minutes.

This limited-space workshop will be a Practical walkthrough implementation of NightwatchJS, an open source framework that allows for selenium webdriver tests.

In this practical talk Shakes will demo how to get up and running with a selenium test on a public web site (suggestions welcome) in 15 minutes!

Framework makes use of NodeJS and Java, which are the only prerequisites (other than a browser), for those that want to bring their laptops along.

If you want a head start on setting up the NightwatchJS prerequisites (recommended), [the project is available on our meetup GitHub page](https://github.com/cape-town-testing/tooling/tree/master/nightwatchjs).
